A basic tower defense game based on game description for [Krampushack 2023](https://tins.amarillion.org/krampu23/): 

(Wishlist by SiegeLord)

1. Player character progression. The character should get stronger, either through intrinsic strength or through items. What was difficult early in the game should become easy.

2. Circles.

3. The color blue.

## implementation of the game wishlist:

1. Towers are upgradable
2. Ornaments to be shot or Circles
3. Color is blue

## Description

This was a first time for me to use unity. 

Tools used:

- ChatGPT and Dalle-3 for artwork
- Affinity designer: to edit and make the art usable as in-game assets.
- Github's Copilot: here and there for suggestions and help me to learn unity!
- Unity with C#

# History

- This is the very alpha version of the game, bugs are around and mechanics could be improved.
